All Souls,Luana,St. Elizabeth,-77.87648,18.07036,Active,Church,"""Foundation and Early History
 The Anglican church at Treasure Beach, often referred to locally as St. Elizabeth-by-the-Sea, serves the small coastal fishing settlements of Calabash Bay, Billy’s Bay, and Frenchman. Anglican outreach to this south-western tip of St. Elizabeth began in the decades following Emancipation (1838), when formerly enslaved Jamaicans began establishing independent coastal and hillside communities. Mission clergy from Black River and Parottee made regular visits to Treasure Beach by mule and boat to hold open-air services and baptisms. By the 1920s, a small timber chapel stood near Calabash Bay, replacing earlier seaside gatherings held under almond trees or in fishermen’s sheds. The present masonry building was completed around the 1940s through local fund-raising, parishioner labour, and support from the Diocese of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. From its beginning, the church served not only as a place of worship but as a symbol of spiritual stability for a newly self-reliant, post-Emancipation fishing community.""","""Structure and Architecture
 St. Elizabeth-by-the-Sea is a modest but well-crafted example of rural twentieth-century Anglican architecture adapted to Jamaica’s coastal environment. The structure is built of local limestone blocks plastered with lime stucco, topped by a low-pitched corrugated-metal roof designed to resist hurricane winds. Its plan is rectangular, with a small vestry and a porch facing the sea. The façade carries a simple wooden cross above the entrance gable, while the pointed lancet windows, fitted with coloured glass and timber shutters, recall the Gothic missionary style of the Victorian era. Inside, the open timber trusses, unpainted pews, and tiled chancel give the space a restrained but reverent simplicity. The adjoining churchyard holds the graves of several early parishioners and fishermen, their markers weathered by salt air—a quiet testament to continuity in this coastal settlement.""","""Clergy and Ministry Development
 Throughout its existence, the church has been part of the Black River Deanery. Early visiting priests such as the Rev. Canon W. R. Campbell and Rev. E. H. Carter conducted services in the mid-twentieth century, often travelling from Parottee or Middle Quarters. The church’s small but faithful congregation comprised primarily fisherfolk, net-makers, and boat-builders, supported by Mothers’ Union volunteers and lay readers. Following Jamaica’s Independence in 1962, the parish took on renewed community roles—offering literacy programs, youth music groups, and hurricane-relief coordination in partnership with nearby schools. The church’s long association with the coastal families of Treasure Beach continues to this day, exemplifying the Anglican commitment to education, worship, and service.""","""Events and Modern Era
 St. Elizabeth-by-the-Sea has endured repeated natural disasters, including the hurricanes of 1951 (Charlie), 1988 (Gilbert), and 2004 (Ivan), each of which damaged the roof and windows. Parishioners repeatedly restored the building, aided by diocesan grants and volunteer labour. Despite coastal erosion and encroaching tides, the limestone foundation remains solid, and the church is still used for special services, weddings, and fishermen’s blessings. Its whitewashed walls and sea-facing orientation make it a beloved landmark in Treasure Beach—a small, enduring emblem of faith, resilience, and Jamaica’s long Anglican heritage from the era of Emancipation to post-Independence nationhood.""",,
Epiphany,Bigwoods District,St. Elizabeth,-77.71237,17.9363,Active,Church,"""Foundation and Early History
 The Church of the Epiphany, located in the Big Woods–Pedro Plains district of southern St. Elizabeth, was established in the latter part of the nineteenth century as part of the Anglican Diocese’s expansion into Jamaica’s post-Emancipation (1838) farming communities. The Pedro Plains region, known for its fertile limestone soil and self-sufficient freeholders, became one of the Diocese’s most active mission fields. Early Anglican work in the area was carried out by clergy from the Black River Deanery, particularly those stationed at Parottee and Southfield, who recognized the need for a permanent place of worship in this growing agricultural zone. The chapel, dedicated to the Epiphany, symbolized the revelation of Christ’s light to all nations and was intended as both a spiritual and social centre for the people of Big Woods and Pedro Plains. From its founding, the church served as a stabilizing influence—offering worship, literacy programs, and a sense of dignity to Jamaica’s newly independent peasantry in the years following Emancipation.""","""Structure and Architecture
 The Church of the Epiphany is built in the restrained Gothic-revival style characteristic of Anglican mission chapels of the Victorian era. The walls are of hand-cut local limestone laid in lime mortar, finished with a smooth whitewashed surface. The plan comprises a rectangular nave, small chancel, and north-side vestry. The west façade features a pointed-arch entrance with dressed-stone trim and a simple bell-cot above the gable. Narrow lancet windows, glazed with coloured glass and fitted with timber shutters, admit filtered light while maintaining airflow in the warm Pedro Plains climate. The interior is open and uncluttered, with an exposed timber roof, handmade wooden pews, and a raised chancel arch framing the altar. Early fittings—including a carved mahogany lectern and baptismal font—reflect local craftsmanship of the late nineteenth century. The churchyard, enclosed by a low stone wall, contains historic graves dating from the 1880s onward, surrounded by lignum-vitae and almond trees.""","""Clergy and Ministry Development
 From its inception, the Church of the Epiphany operated as a mission of the Black River Deanery, its clergy traveling between Big Woods, Parottee, Flagaman, and Southfield. Among the early priests recorded are the Rev. H. C. Wharton and Canon W. R. Campbell, whose itinerant ministry sustained worship across the south-coast plains. During the early twentieth century, the church supported an attached primary school that provided education to children of local farming families. The Mothers’ Union became active by the 1940s, and after Jamaica’s Independence in 1962, lay readers played a key role in maintaining services during intervals between clergy appointments. The church remained a focus for youth work, agricultural training, and literacy outreach, reflecting the Diocese’s commitment to practical as well as spiritual upliftment.""","""Events and Modern Era
 The Church of the Epiphany has endured more than a century of environmental and social change. Hurricanes Charlie (1951) and Gilbert (1988) caused severe roof damage, but the building was restored through parishioner labour and diocesan assistance. In the 2000s, further repairs were made to the bell-cot and roof trusses, preserving the chapel’s traditional form. Today, the church continues active service under the Diocese of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, holding regular Sunday worship and community events for the Big Woods–Pedro Plains district. Its sturdy limestone walls, simple Gothic lines, and serene setting among farmland and coastal breezes embody the continuity of Anglican faith from the post-Emancipation years to the present. The Church of the Epiphany remains not only a place of worship but also a quiet monument to perseverance, craftsmanship, and spiritual light in southern St. Elizabeth.""",,
St Alban's,Stanmore Hill,St. Elizabeth,-77.72293,18.00294,Active,Church,"""Foundation and Early History
 St. Alban’s Anglican Church stands in the district of Burnt Savannah, a broad, fertile plain between Black River and New Market in south-western St. Elizabeth. The community developed during the nineteenth century as freed families left the coastal estates after Emancipation (1838) to farm and build homes on newly available land. The Anglican Diocese of Jamaica extended its outreach into the region soon after, establishing a mission chapel under the oversight of St. John’s Church in Black River. By the 1870s, a permanent stone church had been completed and dedicated to St. Alban, the first British martyr—a name often chosen by Anglican missionaries for rural parishes founded in post-Emancipation Jamaica. The church soon became a central institution for Burnt Savannah’s agrarian population, combining worship, education, and social cohesion.""","""Structure and Architecture
 St. Alban’s is built in the vernacular Gothic revival style typical of Anglican mission churches in rural Jamaica. The structure is of hand-hewn limestone laid in lime mortar, finished with white lime plaster, and set on a raised foundation to prevent flooding from nearby wetlands. The plan consists of a rectangular nave with a small chancel and vestry, a western porch with pointed doorway, and a bell-cot above the gable. The pointed-arch windows, set with coloured glass panes and wooden shutters, allow both ventilation and filtered light. Inside, the church retains its original timber pews, altar rail, and open-truss roof of local hardwood. A simple chancel screen separates the altar space from the nave, and the floor is laid in cement and tile. The surrounding churchyard contains nineteenth-century gravestones, and mature almond and lignum-vitae trees lend the site an atmosphere of tranquility and continuity.""","""Clergy and Ministry Development
 From its establishment, St. Alban’s functioned as a mission of the Black River Deanery, ministered to by clergy who also served Middle Quarters, Slipe, and Parottee. Nineteenth-century records identify the Rev. H. C. Wharton as one of the early visiting priests, succeeded by Canon W. R. Campbell in the early 1900s. The church maintained a small parish school that offered literacy and moral instruction for local children—part of the Anglican Church’s broader post-Emancipation mission of education. During the mid-twentieth century, parishioners formed a Mothers’ Union branch and youth choir, while lay readers ensured regular services when clergy were absent. After Jamaica’s Independence in 1962, St. Alban’s continued to anchor community life, hosting harvest festivals, health fairs, and public meetings that linked faith and civic participation.""","""Events and Modern Era
 Like most south-coast churches, St. Alban’s has weathered hurricanes, floods, and changing rural demographics. Hurricanes in 1951 (Charlie) and 1988 (Gilbert) caused significant roof damage, but parishioners rebuilt each time through local fundraising and diocesan assistance. In the 2000s, the church received modest restoration support for its roof and altar fittings. Though the resident congregation is now smaller, St. Alban’s remains active for Sunday worship, feast days, weddings, and community gatherings. It continues under the Diocese of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, representing more than 140 years of Anglican presence in the Burnt Savannah district. Its enduring limestone walls, peaceful setting, and symbolic dedication to St. Alban make it both a place of faith and a living monument to the resilience of post-Emancipation Jamaica.""",,
St. Stephen's Church,Malvern,St. Elizabeth,-77.7,17.97,Active,Church,"""Foundation and Early History
 All Saints Anglican Church occupies a prominent position in the cool uplands of Malvern, one of Jamaica’s most historically significant educational and religious centres. The church was established in the early 19th century, during a period when the Anglican Church sought to extend its influence into the Santa Cruz Mountains, supporting both the spiritual and intellectual life of the colony. The Malvern area gained early prominence with the founding of Munro College (1856) and Hampton School (1858)—two of Jamaica’s leading Anglican educational institutions—and All Saints became their parish church. Services were initially held in temporary quarters before a permanent stone building was completed in the 1860s, reflecting both the expansion of Anglican mission work and the consolidation of a settled, educated class following Emancipation in 1838. From its earliest years, All Saints served not only the local farming population but also the teachers and students of the Munro and Hampton schools, becoming an enduring symbol of the Anglican Church’s educational and moral leadership in St. Elizabeth.""","""Structure and Architecture
 The current church building is an impressive example of mid-Victorian Gothic revival architecture adapted to Jamaica’s mountainous climate. Built of finely dressed limestone ashlar, the church features a rectangular nave, a pronounced western tower with belfry, and a polygonal chancel. The steeply pitched roof—originally shingled and later replaced with corrugated metal—complements the dramatic backdrop of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Large pointed-arch windows filled with coloured glass and louvred shutters provide light and ventilation. Inside, the open-timber ceiling with arched trusses, polished wooden pews, and stone-flagged floors create an atmosphere of quiet dignity. Memorial plaques to former headmasters and clergy adorn the walls, while the east window depicts the Ascension of Christ, installed as a gift from former pupils of Munro College. The adjoining churchyard contains gravestones of prominent educators and local residents, framed by tall cedar and breadfruit trees. Architecturally, All Saints remains one of the best-preserved nineteenth-century Anglican churches in Jamaica’s interior highlands.""","""Clergy and Ministry Development
 All Saints has been served by some of the most influential Anglican clergy in St. Elizabeth, many of whom were associated with Munro and Hampton Schools. Early rectors included the Rev. A. W. Hill and Canon W. R. Campbell, both of whom combined parish duties with educational oversight. The church’s dual role—as a house of worship and an intellectual centre—has continued throughout its history. In the early 20th century, the church hosted joint services and choral performances with the schools, and by mid-century it became a focal point for the region’s Anglican Youth Fellowship and Mothers’ Union. Following Jamaica’s Independence in 1962, All Saints expanded its outreach, engaging in teacher training and community development programs in collaboration with diocesan education boards. Many clergy and lay leaders who later served across Jamaica began their spiritual formation here.""","""Events and Modern Era
 All Saints Anglican Church has survived numerous storms and social transitions with remarkable continuity. Hurricanes Charlie (1951) and Gilbert (1988) damaged sections of the roof and tower, but restoration was promptly undertaken through parish and diocesan support. Today, the church remains active within the Diocese of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, offering weekly services, student worship for Munro and Hampton, and annual commemorations linking the schools’ founders and alumni. The building stands as both a spiritual and cultural landmark—its limestone tower visible across the Santa Cruz hills. With its deep ties to education, history, and community, All Saints Anglican Church, Malvern represents one of the finest embodiments of Anglican faith and tradition in Jamaica, bridging the eras of Emancipation, Independence, and modern renewal.""",,
St. Thomas',Lacovia,St. Elizabeth,-77.76808,18.09196,Active,Chapel / Church,"""Foundation and Early History
 St. Thomas Anglican Church in Lacovia is one of the earliest Anglican foundations in western Jamaica, tracing its origins to the late seventeenth century, when the English established parish churches following the island’s conquest in 1655. Lacovia—then called St. Elizabeth’s Old Town—was the first parish capital before Black River rose to prominence. A church serving the settlers and estate families existed here by the early 1700s, forming the nucleus of Anglican activity in the district. Over the ensuing centuries, the congregation reflected the island’s changing social order: from the planter elite of the eighteenth century to the emancipated smallholders and craftsmen who emerged after Emancipation in 1838. The parish’s longevity makes it one of the few rural Jamaican churches to have bridged the eras of slavery, freedom, and modern nationhood.","""Structure and Architecture
 The present building, rebuilt after damage from hurricanes and earthquakes, dates largely from the nineteenth century, incorporating portions of earlier stonework. The structure sits on a rise overlooking the Lacovia plains, its thick limestone walls whitewashed and strengthened with buttresses. The plan is a traditional rectangular nave with a small chancel and a western tower topped by a belfry and wooden louvres. Inside, the church retains Georgian proportions—high ceilings, timber trusses, and tall sash-style windows providing light and ventilation. The sanctuary features a carved wooden altar and memorial tablets commemorating early parishioners and clergy. Surrounding the church is an extensive graveyard with headstones dating from the 1700s, many bearing the worn inscriptions of the island’s early colonial families. The architecture reflects both the durability of local craftsmanship and the gradual adaptation of English ecclesiastical design to Jamaica’s tropical climate.""","""Clergy and Ministry Development
 As one of St. Elizabeth’s historic parishes, St. Thomas has long played a leading role within the Black River Deanery. Early rectors were drawn from the small cadre of Anglican clergy who served multiple rural cures across the south coast. In the nineteenth century, the church became a centre for missionary expansion after Emancipation, sending clergy and catechists to outstations at Middle Quarters, Slipe, and even the emerging settlement of Treasure Beach. Parish schools attached to St. Thomas provided basic literacy and Christian instruction to generations of children. During the twentieth century, clergy such as Canon W. R. Campbell and the Rev. Neville deSouza (later Bishop of Jamaica) oversaw restoration work and community outreach. Following Jamaica’s Independence in 1962, the church continued to serve as a stable spiritual and civic anchor for Lacovia’s farming population.""","""Events and Modern Era
 St. Thomas Church has withstood more than three centuries of natural disasters and social transformation—from the 1780 hurricane that leveled parts of St. Elizabeth to the earthquake of 1907 and the winds of Hurricane Gilbert (1988). Its resilience mirrors that of the surrounding community. The church remains active today, hosting Sunday worship, baptisms, and annual harvest festivals, and serving as the mother church for smaller missions across the parish. Restoration efforts, supported by the Jamaica National Heritage Trust, aim to preserve both the structure and the historic graveyard as part of Jamaica’s Anglican heritage. St. Thomas Anglican Church, with its enduring limestone walls and long record of ministry, stands as a living monument to faith, emancipation, and perseverance in the rural heart of St. Elizabeth.""",,
